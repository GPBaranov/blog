## ðŸ—“ What Got Done This Week

This week was productive â€” I really felt how important it is to balance theory and practice.

- Finished a graph visualization project in Python using the NetworkX library. Surprisingly flexible, especially when combined with Matplotlib.
- Learned core Git operations at the command line level. Creating branches, resolving conflicts, pull requests â€” everything makes much more sense now.
- Within the algorithms course, explored optimization methods on graphs. Seeing Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm applied to real problems makes it feel far less abstract.
- Started gathering materials for my mini-research project on "parallel computing and its applications in big data processing."

In short: Iâ€™ve gained more knowledge â€” and even more questions. And thatâ€™s probably the best outcome.
