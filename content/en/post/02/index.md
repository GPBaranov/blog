# Academic Week Summary

Another week is behind us! We worked through algorithms and data structures, delved into Python fundamentals, and got familiar with the principles of operating systems.  

The topic that impressed me most was multithreading — turns out parallel computing is used almost everywhere. Now I really want to try it in practice.  

How’s your studying going? Was there anything particularly challenging or exciting? Feel free to share!
