# 📍 Weekly Summary — Brief and to the Point

The week was quite intense, but not overwhelming. Here are the main highlights:

- 🔄 We explored sorting algorithms — compared efficiency, calculated complexity, and tested them on real arrays.
- ⚙️ In our OOP practice, we wrote our own classes with operator overloading — finally starting to see why it matters beyond textbooks.
- 💬 Got our first course project topics — time to start defining the tasks and thinking about the architecture.
- 🧠 Took part in a mini-discussion on neural networks — not too deep, but it definitely sparked more interest.

We’re gradually reaching the point where there's enough knowledge to make conscious decisions in code. That feels good.
