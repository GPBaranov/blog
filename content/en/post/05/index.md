## 📚 Weekly Summary

The week was productive and varied. Here's what I managed to do:

- 🧪 Completed a lab project on modeling — had to wrestle with equations, but the result turned out surprisingly good.
- 💻 Practiced writing multithreaded code in C++ — started to grasp thread synchronization more clearly.
- 📊 Learned the basics of data visualization in Python using Seaborn — the graphs are now much more insightful.
- 📝 Drafted the structure for my term paper — ready to move on to implementation with confidence.
- 🎓 Attended a student seminar — listened to an insightful talk on distributed computing.

I’ve gained more knowledge — and even more motivation. A week well spent!
