## 📅 Weekly Summary  

This week was eventful! Here are a few key highlights:  

- 🎓 Got the hang of **recursive algorithms** – turned out easier than it seemed at first.  
- 🔬 Broke the experiment during the physics lab, but at least we learned what *not* to do.  
- 🔄 Finally understood how **closures** work in programming. Now the code looks cleaner!  
- 📖 Started reading a book on **programming paradigms** – it’s mind-bending, but fascinating.  
- 🏃‍♂️ Broke out of the "study-home" loop and went for a walk – nature really helps reboot.
