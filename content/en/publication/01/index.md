# üîÑ Version Control. Git  

## What Is Version Control?  

Version control is the process of tracking and managing changes to code. It‚Äôs especially important for teamwork, when multiple developers are making edits to the same project.  

**Why is it important?**  
- ‚úÖ Allows you to roll back to a previous version of the code  
- ‚úÖ Helps track changes and their authors  
- ‚úÖ Makes collaborative development easier  

## Git ‚Äì The Main Version Control Tool  

Git is the most popular distributed version control system (VCS). It‚Äôs used by developers around the world and powers platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.  

### üîπ Core Git Concepts  

1. **Local and Remote Repositories**  
   - Git stores all changes in a **local repository** on your machine.  
   - The repository can be synchronized with a **remote server**, such as GitHub.  

2. **Commits and Change History**  
   - A **commit** is a saved snapshot of changes in the project history.  
   - Each commit has a unique **hash** (identifier) to easily track edits.  

3. **Branching and Merging**  
   - Git allows you to create **branches** to work on new features without breaking the main code.  
   - Once finished, the branch can be **merged** into the main one.  

4. **Conflict Resolution**  
   - If two developers modify the same file, a **conflict** may occur.  
   - Git allows you to manually choose which changes to keep.  

5. **Team Collaboration**  
   - Developers make changes in **their own branches**.  
   - After review, changes are **merged** into the main branch.  
   - This prevents chaos and improves quality control.  

## Why Is Git Better Than Just Copying Files?  

| Storage Method          | Version Control | Rollback Capability | Team Collaboration |  
|-------------------------|------------------|----------------------|--------------------|  
| Simple file copying     | ‚ùå No            | ‚ùå No                | ‚ùå No              |  
| Git                     | ‚úÖ Yes           | ‚úÖ Yes               | ‚úÖ Yes             |  

## Conclusion  

Git is a powerful tool for managing code versions. If you‚Äôre developing software, learning Git is a must-have skill!
