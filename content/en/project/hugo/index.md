## Why Does Every Researcher Need a Website Today?

The internet has become the main channel of scientific communication. Presentations, papers, projects, courses — people search for and find all of this online.

- Easy updates — everything is edited as plain text.

Plus, the theme is actively maintained and developed, so you’re not left alone with the documentation.
