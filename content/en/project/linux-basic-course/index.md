# 🐧 Linux Course: From Beginner to Confident User

This week I completed a course on the fundamentals of the **Linux** operating system. Here's what I learned and my overall impressions.

---

## 🚀 Where Did It Start?

The course was designed for **absolute beginners**, and that was clear from the start. We began with the **installation of Linux**, and no prior setup was needed — everything was explained step by step, clearly and accessibly.

---

## 🖥 Graphical Interface: Nothing to Fear

The first introduction was through the **graphical interface** — quite similar to the familiar Windows or macOS environments. The key was learning not to fear the new system.

---

## 💻 Command Line: From Skepticism to Admiration

At first, using the terminal felt difficult. But gradually I learned:
- how to navigate files,  
- how to launch programs,  
- how to use powerful commands,  
and why the **CLI** isn’t scary — it's **efficient and powerful**.

---

## 🌐 Working with a Remote Server

The next part focused on connecting to **remote servers**. We learned how to:
- connect via SSH,  
- run programs remotely,  
- copy output back to our local machines.

---

## 🛠 Advanced Topics

The final section of the course covered more advanced concepts:  
- writing **bash scripts**,  
- mastering the **vim** text editor,  
- automating everyday tasks.

---

## 📋 Practice and Knowledge Checks

Throughout the course, there were plenty of **tests and hands-on exercises**. I especially enjoyed the bash scripting tasks — great for boosting logical thinking and attention to detail.

---

## 🎓 Certificate

The course is complete, and I’ve received my [certificate of completion](https://stepik.org/cert/2833767) 🎉

Highly recommended for anyone who wants to feel confident in Linux — whether you're a beginner developer or just a curious learner.
